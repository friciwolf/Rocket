# Rocket

**Rocket** is an application launcher for KDE Plasma. It sorts all of your applications in a horizontal or vertical grid alphabetically, so you will always find what you are looking for at first glance. No more menu navigation, only scrolling.

Features:
 - Customizable row and column sizes
 - Theming
 - Search for keywords (such as "file manager")
 - Scroll support for touchpad, mouse and the mouse wheel
 - Keyboard navigation

For more information check out the wiki and the release notes.

Please also send in bug reports, development is still in early stage*. It has been tested on Kubuntu, but it should also work on any platform with KDE installed.

\* Disclaimer: I'm not a professional developer, but it works on my configuration perfectly, and I love it. However, on your custom environment, you might experience unwanted bugs -- feel free to fork and to contribute.
This software does not contain any code which messes with your base system, so if it does not work for you, it's easy to uninstall -- just follow the instructions in the release notes.

Rocket's icon was taken from the [OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/) library.
