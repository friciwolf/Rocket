# Rocket

**Rocket** is an application launcher for KDE Plasma. It sorts all of your applications in a horizontal grid alphabetically, so you will always find what you are looking for at first glance. No more menu navigation, only scrolling.

Features:
 - Customizable row and column sizes
 - Theming
 - Search for keywords (such as "file manager")
 - Scroll support for touchpad, mouse and the mouse wheel
 - Keyboard navigation

Please send in bug reports, development is still in early stage*. It has been tested on Kubuntu, but it should also work on any platform with KDE installed.
