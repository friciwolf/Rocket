# Rocket

**Rocket** is an application launcher for KDE Plasma. It sorts all of your applications in a horizontal or vertical grid alphabetically, so you will always find what you are looking for at first glance. No more menu navigation, only scrolling.

Features:
 - Customizable row and column sizes
 - Theming
 - Search for keywords (such as "file manager")
 - Scroll support for touchpad, mouse and the mouse wheel
 - Keyboard navigation
 - Launch by pressing the Meta button

For more information check out the **wiki** and the **release notes**.

# Installation

Rocket has been tested on Kubuntu and on Debian, but it should also work on any platform with KDE installed.

Clone the repository or download the zipped file in the folder ```installer```. Then make the bash script ```installer.sh``` executable via ```chmod +x installer.sh``` and run it with ```./installer.sh```.
